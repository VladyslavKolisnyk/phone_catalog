# React Phone catalog
- In this project I make a website for phones from Apple. It has three tabs, also for things that the implementation of which is not reconsidered by the project I add an error message.
      -During development, I use:
      - - HTML;
      - - SASS;
      - - Library React;
      - - Typescript;
      - - Syntax extension to TS TSX;
      - - Library React-router;
      - - Library lodash namely debounce;
